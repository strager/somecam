# How card sorting works

SoMeCaM presents you with 26 cards, each representing a potential source
of meaning in your life. Through a multi-step sorting process, you
narrow these down to a small handful that resonate most with you.

## Step 1: Initial sorting

You are shown each of the 26 cards one at a time. Each card displays a
statement — for example, _"I intervene when I see injustice being done"_
or _"Freedom is the most important thing for me"_. At this stage, you do
not see the name of the source of meaning behind each card; you only see
the statement itself.

For each card, you choose one of three responses:

- **Agree** — this statement resonates with you
- **Disagree** — this statement does not resonate with you
- **Unsure** — you are not sure

You can swipe the card (on touch devices) or click the buttons. An undo
button lets you go back and change your mind on any previous card. A
progress bar tracks how far along you are.

After all 26 cards have been sorted, you move on. If you agreed with
5 or fewer cards, those become your chosen sources of meaning and you
skip straight to your results. If you agreed with more than 5, you
continue to the narrowing step.

> **Note:** If you agreed with fewer than 3 cards, your "unsure" cards
> are included alongside your "agree" cards for the narrowing step, so
> you have enough to work with.

## Step 2: Narrowing down

In this step, you revisit only the cards that passed the initial sort.
The goal is to keep your top 3–5 sources of meaning.

An important change happens here: each card now reveals the **name of
its source of meaning** alongside the original statement. For example,
you might see the label _"Social commitment"_ above the statement _"I
intervene when I see injustice being done"_. This additional context
helps you make more deliberate choices.

For each card, you choose:

- **Keep** — this source of meaning stays in your selection
- **Remove** — this source of meaning is set aside

There is no "unsure" option in this step. As before, you can undo
individual choices. A counter shows how many cards you have kept so far.

When you have reviewed all the cards in this round, every card you kept
becomes part of your final selection, and you are taken to your results.

## Step 3: Editing your selection

From the results page, you can click **Edit selection** to revisit your
choices at any time. The edit page shows all 26 cards in a checklist.
Selected cards are highlighted with a green border and a checked
checkbox; unselected cards are dimmed.

You can:

- **Check** any card to add it to your selection.
- **Uncheck** any card to remove it. If you have already explored a card
  (answered reflection questions about it), you will be asked to confirm
  before removing it, since your exploration answers would no longer
  appear on the results page.

Click **Done** to save your changes and return to the results page with
your updated selection.
